The indicators.finders are programs that engineer variables to detect certain "context" in sentences that indicate the class of sentence tokens and make guesses of class based on that context.
Be sure to review any script with "guess" in the title so you can see how the "guess" algorithm works.
These scripts must be completed before classifyTEST.R is called.

The indicators.finders are programs that engineer variables to detect certain "context" in sentences that indicate the class of sentence tokens and make guesses of class based on that context.
Be sure to review any script with "guess" in the title so you can see how the "guess" algorithm works. Excuse the fragmented "cond" files but I found that in R breaking a program up in this way speeds things up greatly.
These scripts must be completed before classifyTEST.R is called.

To run all indicators, run RUNINDICATORS.R in the directory where this body of files/data is contained.
